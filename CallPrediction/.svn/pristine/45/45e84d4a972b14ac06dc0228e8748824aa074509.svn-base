STEPS

1. Read a call log from a file consisting of call entries of this format:

Phone Number:--- +31646334641 
Call Type:--- INCOMING 
Call Date:--- Tue May 27 11:49:22 CEST 2014 
Call duration in sec :--- 105

.

Generates weekday- and weekend clusters using hierarchical clustering and writes them to 2 separate files.
See void com.avg.innovation.call_prediction.HClustCallRecords.clusterCallStats(String callLogFile, String weekClusterFileName, String weekendClusterFileName) throws Exception

2. Suggest up to 5 phone numbers likely to call next based on one's call history.
See  Collection<String> com.avg.innovation.call_prediction.PredictNextCall.predict(String callLogFile, String weekClusterFileName, String weekendClusterFileName) throws Exception
First compute 1st and 2nd order Markov probability statistics on both the weekday and weekend clusters.
Then compute the probability of the actual timestamp (at the time of call prediction) belonging to each of the individual clusters assuming that each cluster has a normal distribution wrt. time. 
Finally it aggregates the top most likely call numbers from each of the clusters (based on cluster probability and 1st and 2nd order Markov probability statistics) also using some heuristics.
