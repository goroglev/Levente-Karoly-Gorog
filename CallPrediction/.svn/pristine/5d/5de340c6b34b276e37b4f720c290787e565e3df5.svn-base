1. have clusters for weekdays / weekend
2. given a time of the day, retrieve the two clusters closest to that time
	2.1. testing - .5hrs
3. compute the prob of a timestamp belonging to a cluster - jeroen's formula - 1hrs
	3.1. normal dist. probs
4. prediction - 2.5hrs
	4.1. day of the week, current time, last two successful calls - from call log
	4.2. unsuccessful calls if any
	4.3. most prob. numbers based on weighted cluster stats + thresholding (?)
	4.4. testing

No inbetween-clusters stats.
