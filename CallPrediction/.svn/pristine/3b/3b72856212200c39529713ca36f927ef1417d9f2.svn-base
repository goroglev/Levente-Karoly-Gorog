* clustering every day

* test clustering (it takes < 1 min on my laptop)

* clustering takes as arg a list of call records / call log file, writes clusters (week / weekend) to two separate files
* prediction takes week / weekend clusters and outputs phone numbers as strings.
* how to organize code? two main classes, one for clustering, other for prediction?
